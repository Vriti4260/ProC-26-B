Step 1
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess.

Step 2
Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined.

Step 3
Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes.

Step 4
Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the batter to divide it evenly.

Step 5
Bake for 30-35 minutes in a 350 degree oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Step 6
Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely.

Step 7
Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!
